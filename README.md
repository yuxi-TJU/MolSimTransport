-- The /MolSimTransport directory contains the calculation scripts and atomic data files.

-- The /share directory contains the following:

EM template files and cluster electrode structure files for the L2 scheme.

Junction templates for different interfaces, pre-calculated Hamiltonian and surface Green's function files for the PL electrode, and scripts for calculating current and converting XYZ files to POSCAR files in the L3 scheme.

-- The /test_file directory holds test files for all three schemes, consistent with those provided in the manual.
